## How Do Undress AI Apps Work?  
Undress AI apps typically follow these steps:  
1. **Upload an Image:** Users upload a photo of a person.  
2. **AI Processing:** The app uses deep learning algorithms to analyze the image and predict what the person might look like without clothing.  
3. **Generate Output:** The app produces a manipulated image, often with adjustable settings for realism.  
4. **Download or Share:** Users can save or share the edited image.  

These apps rely on neural networks trained on large datasets of images to achieve realistic results. However, the accuracy and quality of the output depend on the app’s technology and the input image’s quality.
